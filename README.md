This is a replacement for the default new tab page on Chrome. I'll probably add Firefox later. It's meant to provide fewer distractions in order to minimise the amount of time wasted online. It will also have countdown clocks for different periods such as the day, week, month and year. Might be a bit stressful but it'll serve as a reminder to be mindful of time.
